Performed example demos on object oriented Selenium WebDriver API

# WebDriver
WebDriver uses browser automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control the browser and run tests. 

In this project, I have engaged in hands-on practice with commonly used Selenium WebDriver APIs. Like Browser Actions, Web Elements , Relative Locators, Waits, Alerts, Proxy, Page Loading Strategies, Keyboard, Mouse and Drop Down Actions.
